# Malaysia Employment Act Calculator

Here are some of the quantitative aspects of the Employment Act in Malaysia that can be expressed in mathematical terms:

    1. Calculation of wages:
        Basic rate of pay = Total monthly salary / Number of working days in the month
        Overtime pay = (Basic rate of pay x 1.5) x Number of hours worked overtime

    2. Maximum working hours:
        Maximum daily working hours = 8
        Maximum weekly working hours = 48

    3. Payment of wages:
        Frequency of payment = At least once a month
        Payment deadline = Within 7 days after the end of the salary period
        Deductions = Income tax + Employee Provident Fund contributions

    4. Annual leave:
        Entitlement = 8 days per year (for the first 2 years of employment), increasing to 12 days per year thereafter
        Calculation of entitlement = Number of years of service x 8 or 12 days

    5. Sick leave:
        Entitlement = 14 days per year (for hospitalization) or 22 days per year (for non-hospitalization)
        Calculation of entitlement = Based on the number of months of service

These are some examples of how certain provisions of the Employment Act in Malaysia can be expressed in mathematical terms. 

However, it's important to note that the Act also includes many non-quantitative aspects, 

such as rules for the termination of employment and guidelines for the treatment of foreign workers, 

which cannot be easily translated into mathematical models.
